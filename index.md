### Predicting Online Customers' Purchasing Intention
The stratospheric growth of online shopping has allowed companies to collect massive amounts of data and study consumers' behaviour. I was curious to find out what were the most important characteristics that determine a online customer's purchasing decision. A random forest approach was used in conjunction with permutation feature importance and partial dependence plots.

### Analysing Conspicuous Consumption in Countries with an Emerging Middle Class
This was my thesis for my Masters programme. The studyâ€™s goal was to understand the impact of the emerging middle class on the conspicuous consumption of different socio-economic groups in Indonesia and the Philippines. K-means clustering was first used to determine the social stratification of each country. The clusters were then included in a multiple linear regression to study the interaction between different clusters and state-level median income.

### Multiple Correspondence Analysis of a Government's Efficacy
An individual's expectations of their government can vary based on his country of citizenship. In this project, I use multiple correspondence analysis to examine the association between different aspects of a government's responsibility for Switzerland and Australia.
